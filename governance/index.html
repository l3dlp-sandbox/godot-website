	<h3>Legal status</h3>
	<p>
		On its own, Godot has no legal status. Godot exists as a member project of
		the <a href="https://sfconservancy.org">Software Freedom Conservancy</a>
		(SFC). The SFC provides a home and infrastructure for Free, Libre, and Open
		Source Software (FLOSS) projects by aggregating the work necessary for
		running a non-profit organization including accounting and legal compliance.
		For more information about what the SFC provides, please refer to <a
			href="https://sfconservancy.org/projects/services/">their website</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>As no company is behind Godot, it can't be sold or purchased by another company.</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		While the SFC provides the corporate infrastructure to support the Godot
		project, it doesn't make decisions for the project. Instead it provides a
		set of rules for how the member projects operate and provides financial
		oversight to make sure that money is spent in a responsible way that
		advances the project and fits with Conservancy's 501(c)(3) mission to
		promote, advance, and defend software freedom. Each member project has a
		Project Leadership Committee that instructs the SFC on how to spend that
		project's funding.
	</p>

	<h3 id="plc">The Project Leadership Committee</h3>
	<p>
		The Project Leadership Committee (PLC) is responsible for making all funding
		and institutional decisions for the Godot project. The PLC is made of the
		project founders (Ariel Manzur and Juan Linietsky) as well as trusted
		contributors and community members. As spaces open up on the PLC, current
		members may reach out to contributors and community members with a proven
		track record and deep understanding of the project and ask them to join.
	</p>
	<p>
		The PLC must be made of a balance of contributors with technical expertise,
		and community members who bring the perspective of the community at large.
		The PLC is subject to rules set by the Software Freedom Conservancy. For
		more information about the PLC's policies please refer to the
		<a href="https://sfconservancy.org/projects/policies/">Software Freedom
			Conservancy's project policies</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		The PLC currently consists of the following members:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Ariel Manzur — <i>ariel@godotengine.org</i></li>
		<li>Bastiaan Olij — <i>bastiaan@godotengine.org</i></li>
		<li>Clay John — <i>clay@godotengine.org</i></li>
		<li>George Marques — <i>george@godotengine.org</i></li>
		<li>HP van Braam — <i>hp@godotengine.org</i></li>
		<li>Ilaria Cislaghi — <i>ilaria@godotengine.org</i></li>
		<li>Juan Linietsky — <i>juan@godotengine.org</i></li>
		<li>Julian Murgia — <i>julian@godotengine.org</i></li>
		<li>Rémi Verschelde — <i>remi@godotengine.org</i></li>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="advisors">Advisors</h3>
	<p>
		The PLC has enlisted the help of its most trusted and veteran contributors
		whom they call <em>the advisors</em>. The advisors are consulted on usage
		of funds as well as institutional matters. It is important to note,
		however, that while the advice of the advisory panel is weighed heavily,
		the final authority on these matters remains with the PLC. In practice,
		the PLC rarely makes an important decision without at least discussing it
		with the advisors first.
	</p>
	<p>
		Like the PLC, contributors do not apply to become advisors. Instead the
		process of joining the advisors group is organic; trusted contributors may
		be asked to join after showing dedication, expertise, and leadership
		within the Godot community. As a result, the advisors are a diverse group
		of individuals with expertise in all areas of Godot development.
	</p>

	<h3>Funding decisions</h3>
	<p>
		All donations and sponsorships go directly to the SFC. The Godot PLC makes
		all decisions on how the funds are used, following rules established by
		Software Freedom Conservancy. These rules dictate that funding can only be
		used for the benefit of the project. Usage of funds generally includes:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Hiring contributors</li>
		<li>Organizing events</li>
		<li>Reimbursements for travelling to events</li>
		<li>Purchasing hardware required for contributors to work on Godot</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		While the exact costs spent remain private, we do our best to publish how
		much we get and how much we spend. All funding decisions are ultimately
		approved by the Software Freedom Conservancy which has strict (but
		reasonable) <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/projects/policies/conservancy-travel-policy.html">limits on spending,
			hourly rates, and reimbursements</a>.
		As such, no one hired receives more than industry standard rates.
	</p>

	<h3>Technical decisions</h3>
	<p>
		Technical decisions are made by Area Owners and the project leaders.
		Godot has the following established roles:
	</p>

	<h4>Leadership</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Juan Linietsky — Technical and Project Lead</li>
		<li>Rémi Verschelde — Project Manager</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The project leaders have final say on all code merges. In theory, this means
		the leaders will have the final say when maintainers cannot agree. In
		practice, this authority rarely needs to be invoked because decisions are
		made by maintainers in consultation with the community.
	</p>

	<h4>Teams and area owners</h4>
	<p>
		<a href="/teams">Engine teams</a> are groups of contributors interested in
		a specific area of the engine. Teams provide a way for contributors to have
		focused discussions with other people with similar expertise and interests.
		The opinion and expertise of team members is valued in discussions, but
		ultimately the authority over an area of the engine belongs solely to the
		area owner and the project leadership. Area owners are entrusted with final
		say for code merges in their areas. Area owners are trusted contributors who
		are chosen by the project leadership and have shown knowledge of the specific
		area of the engine and the engine's philosophy as a whole.
	</p>
	<p>
		In practice, area owners aim for consensus among contributors, especially
		among the relevant team. The "rule of thumb" is to not merge code if
		significant disputes exist over a change. However the final decision still
		remains with the area owner. The Godot project strives for rich, public,
		technical discussions where anyone can contribute and agree on the way to
		move forward. Additionally, the leadership and area owners consult with
		other contributors and the community as much as possible every time new
		features and improvements are planned.
	</p>

	<h4>Community</h4>
	<p>
		We strive to make our relationship with the community as symbiotic as
		possible within the limits of feasibility. The Godot community is made up of
		users, contributors, maintainers, and project leadership. Godot exists
		because its community trusts the work we do, so we try to entrust the
		community with deciding the general direction of the project as much and as
		openly as possible. This is how we see the process as community-driven:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Open development:</strong> All development (code that makes it
			into the engine, docs, website, etc) is made via
			<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls">Pull Requests</a>.
			They are open for anyone to see, review and comment on. From the
			leadership to the new contributors, everyone is required to create them in
			order for their work to be included. Pull Requests are approved and merged
			by the respective area maintainers while, again, always striving to
			promote agreement before moving forward. All improvements to the engine
			are made through the Pull Requests of community members.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Open discussion:</strong> Before doing any significant amount of
			work, we encourage maintainers, contributors, and community to open and
			discuss features and proposals in the <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals">Godot proposals
				repository</a>.
			This allows all contributors to have a much better understanding of how users expect
			the new feature to be used. Because the primary aim of Godot is to produce
			a useful tool, we ask those who open proposals to discuss real-world use
			cases based on problems they are having with their current projects. This
			allows maintainers and contributors to have a much more "down to earth"
			understanding of user's requirements. This philosophy is best explained in
			the <a
				href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/community/contributing/best_practices_for_engine_contributors.html">engine
				contributor guidelines</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Community-minded:</strong> The Godot project is developed by and
			for the community. No corporate entity exists behind Godot that
			prioritizes one feature over another. Priorities are set by project
			leadership and area maintainers based on the feedback of the community in
			bug reports, proposals, and discussions in the various community channels.
			Ultimately, it is the community that determines the direction of the
			project.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Every improvement to the engine, whether it is a feature or bug fix, is
		driven forward by Godot's community of contributors, users, maintainers, and
		leadership. Godot wouldn't exist in its current form without the countless
		contributions it receives from community members every day.
